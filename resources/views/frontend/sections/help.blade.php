                        <p>Yes. We are 100% real. Our team has experienced the hassles of long and arduous loan processes. The problem with most loan agreements is that they are inhumane. Even to get a loan in an emergency, you have to go through the same time-consuming loops of documentation, approvals, and hidden charges. By the time you reach the end, either the time is lost or the loan has become way too expensive for your pocket.</p>

                        <p>Since we have felt that burn as consumers, we wanted to create something that would be miles ahead of the market. Our application-to-approval technology takes care of all the data aggregation, so you don’t have to worry about the paperwork. If you carry a decent credit score, getting a loan of $2,000-$8,000 would be a process that doesn’t last more than a few minutes.</p>
